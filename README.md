DOWNLOADING OF CSV FILES

#step 1:-

You can use any data-set u want to, but i've used this data set(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats)
I can'nt able to put this in my repositories because it have the size of 1GB but repositories allow only atmost 25MB file
First you have to download it then extract all the files from zip-file.
